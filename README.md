## PeerTutor

Single Page Application that allows college students to provide free tutoring on campus to their peers, and receive tips for their help. Users can open requests for a specific course and a question, and they can choose from a list of tutors (who are currently willing to help out). Every user is initially a tutee, but can register as a tutor to start providing help to their peers. Once the tutoring session is over, tutee can optionally provide tips and transfer a few bucks to tutorâ€™s account.
